## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Setup

To set up this file, simple launch the index.html file. Make sure all the contents are within the same directory.

## Overview

The landing page uses javascript to track if the user's window is viewing the page. It then updates css rules regarding the navbar's color and also updates the class name of whatever section is being viewed so that the animation in the background plays. The page uses javascript to dynamically generate tabs on the navigation bar by creating list elements and appending them. It also uses the built in javascript scrollIntoView function to scroll the viewport to whatever section is clicked on.
